# GeoCracker

### GeoCracker aims to assist with learning Geoguessr metas in a hands-on fashion. 
#### Like Geoguessr, you are dropped in a random street view in the world, except GeoCracker identifies nearby objects unique to a region, highlights the objects, and outputs a small description about what region the object is commonly found in.
#### GeoCracker is in development and currently the VGG16 model can predict with 80+% accuracy if an image contains an Austrian bollard or not.
